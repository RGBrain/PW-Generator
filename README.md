# Password Generator

## Description

**Front-End Web Development Bootcamp - Module 5 Challenge**

This password generator creates a pseudo-random password based on user choices, and displays it to the webpage.

## Installation

No need to install, simply visit:  **https://rgbrain.github.io/PW-Generator/**

## Usage

Having visited https://rgbrain.github.io/PW-Generator/, click on the 'Generate Password' button.  You will then be prompted to make a number of choices:

* Number of characters
* Include Special characters?
* Include Numberic characters?
* Include Lowercase characters?
* Include Uppercase characters?

NB. Number of characters must be between 10 and 64 (inclusive) and at least one character set must be chosen.

A pseudo-random password will then appear in the box on the page - see below screenshot.
