## Features

This code performs and displays financial analysis of a set of hard-coded financial records.  The project in its current state is not feature-rich.


## How to Contribute

All of the computational code would work with any array of months and profit/loss in the following: [["string", number],["string", number]...] - so an obvious improvement would be to create an interface that would accept other arrays of financial information and return the analysis.  Why not take a branch and see what you can do...?
